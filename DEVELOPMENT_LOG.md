## Session: 2025-09-20 - Gmail Integration Complete + UI Improvements

### Goals Accomplished âœ…

- [x] Gmail API integration with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- [x] Real financial email filtering from Bolero, KBC, ING, Belfius
- [x] Email content parsing and display with full email bodies
- [x] User authentication flow with manual token exchange
- [x] Secure IPC communication between Electron and React
- [x] Real-time email refresh functionality
- [x] UI improvements: removed Belgium flag, fixed text overflow
- [x] Responsive design for better window resizing
- [x] Updated documentation to reflect Gmail integration completion

### Technical Decisions Made (Gmail Integration)

- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: Manual token exchange approach for desktop app reliability
- **Security**: Moved Gmail API to main process with secure IPC communication
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive authentication state management
- **UI/UX**: Responsive design with proper text wrapping and overflow handling
- **Documentation**: Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect current project status

### Current Architecture (Gmail Integration)

```bash
App.jsx (Main Component)
â”œâ”€â”€ Authentication State Management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ isAuthenticated (OAuth status)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ authUrl (for manual OAuth flow)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ userProfile (Gmail account info)
â”œâ”€â”€ Real Gmail Integration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ loadFinancialEmails() - fetches from Gmail API
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Email filtering for Belgian financial institutions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Full email content with preview truncation
â””â”€â”€ Responsive Email Interface
    â”œâ”€â”€ Email List (left panel) - now with real data
    â”œâ”€â”€ Email Details (right panel) - shows full content
    â””â”€â”€ AI Processing Button (ready for Ollama)
```

### Initial Goals Accomplished âœ…

- [x] Created basic Electron application with window management
- [x] Integrated React 18 with modern hooks and components
- [x] Built beautiful financial dashboard UI with gradients and animations
- [x] Implemented interactive email list with sample data
- [x] Added email selection and processing simulation
- [x] Set up Webpack build system for React in Electron
- [x] Created professional styling with modern CSS features

### Technical Decisions Made (Initial Setup)

- **Electron + React**: Chosen for desktop app with modern UI capabilities
- **Webpack + Babel**: For building JSX to JavaScript in Electron context
- **Component-based architecture**: Using React hooks for state management
- **Modern CSS**: Gradients, backdrop-filter, and animations for professional look
- **Sample data approach**: Start with mock emails before Gmail API integration

### Current Architecture

```bash
App.jsx (Main Component)
â”œâ”€â”€ State Management (useState hooks)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ emails (array of email objects)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ selectedEmail (currently selected email)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ isProcessing (AI processing state)
â”œâ”€â”€ Email List Component (left panel)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sample Bolero/KBC emails
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Click to select functionality
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Visual selection indicators
â””â”€â”€ Email Details Component (right panel)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Selected email display
    â”œâ”€â”€ AI processing button
    â””â”€â”€ Processing simulation
```

### Next Session Goals ðŸŽ¯

- [ ] Gmail API integration for real email data
- [ ] Ollama AI connection for Dutch translation
- [ ] Replace sample data with live Gmail feeds
- [ ] Add email filtering for financial content
- [ ] Implement real AI processing workflow

### Technical Notes

- React builds to `src/renderer/dist/app.js` via Webpack
- Electron loads React via `src/renderer/index.html`
- CSS uses modern features (backdrop-filter requires newer browsers/Electron)
- Component state is local to App.jsx (will need state management for larger app)

### Challenges Encountered

- Initial MCP Knowledge Graph package not available
- Using file-based memory approach instead
- Webpack configuration needed for CSS and JSX processing

### Resources Used

- React 18 documentation for hooks patterns
- Electron documentation for window management
- Modern CSS techniques for financial dashboard aesthetics
