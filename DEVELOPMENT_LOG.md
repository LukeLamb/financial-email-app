# Development Log

## Session: 2025-09-20 - Initial Electron + React Setup

### Goals Accomplished âœ…

- [x] Created basic Electron application with window management
- [x] Integrated React 18 with modern hooks and components
- [x] Built beautiful financial dashboard UI with gradients and animations
- [x] Implemented interactive email list with sample data
- [x] Added email selection and processing simulation
- [x] Set up Webpack build system for React in Electron
- [x] Created professional styling with modern CSS features

### Technical Decisions Made

- **Electron + React**: Chosen for desktop app with modern UI capabilities
- **Webpack + Babel**: For building JSX to JavaScript in Electron context
- **Component-based architecture**: Using React hooks for state management
- **Modern CSS**: Gradients, backdrop-filter, and animations for professional look
- **Sample data approach**: Start with mock emails before Gmail API integration

### Current Architecture

```bash
App.jsx (Main Component)
â”œâ”€â”€ State Management (useState hooks)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ emails (array of email objects)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ selectedEmail (currently selected email)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ isProcessing (AI processing state)
â”œâ”€â”€ Email List Component (left panel)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sample Bolero/KBC emails
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Click to select functionality
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Visual selection indicators
â””â”€â”€ Email Details Component (right panel)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Selected email display
    â”œâ”€â”€ AI processing button
    â””â”€â”€ Processing simulation
```

### Next Session Goals ðŸŽ¯

- [ ] Gmail API integration for real email data
- [ ] Ollama AI connection for Dutch translation
- [ ] Replace sample data with live Gmail feeds
- [ ] Add email filtering for financial content
- [ ] Implement real AI processing workflow

### Technical Notes

- React builds to `src/renderer/dist/app.js` via Webpack
- Electron loads React via `src/renderer/index.html`
- CSS uses modern features (backdrop-filter requires newer browsers/Electron)
- Component state is local to App.jsx (will need state management for larger app)

### Challenges Encountered

- Initial MCP Knowledge Graph package not available
- Using file-based memory approach instead
- Webpack configuration needed for CSS and JSX processing

### Resources Used

- React 18 documentation for hooks patterns
- Electron documentation for window management
- Modern CSS techniques for financial dashboard aesthetics
